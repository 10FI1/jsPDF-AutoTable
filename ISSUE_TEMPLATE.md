Feature requests, bug reports etc are very welcome as issues. But questions are directed to StackOverflow with the tags `jspdf` and `jspdf-autotable`.

If you are experiencing a bug, try to create a [mcve](https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve) and include runnable code that is clearly showing your issue. You can use for example this [codepen template](http://codepen.io/someatoms/pen/EjwPEb) as a base with `jspdf` and `jspdf-autotable` already included. Try to make sure and show in your issue that the issue is actually related to this plugin and not your framework of choice, jspdf or your setup.
